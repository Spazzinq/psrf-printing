# PSRF Sustainable Printing Board
The Sustainable Printing project is an initiative to reduce paper waste and emissions at Swarthmore College as motivated by the College’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2035 (“To Zero By Thirty-Five”). The project will research and advise new printing technologies, as well as analyze the environmental effect from current efforts to deploy sustainable printers and implement new swipe-release technology across the College’s libraries, dorms, and departmental printers. As a social component, the project will work with print users to foster an understanding of swipe-release, promote sustainable printing behaviors, as well as celebrate the benefits of the new sustainable printing technologies with the general campus community.
